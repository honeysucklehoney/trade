  Table cloths from my childhood sent to me when my parents moved across the country, table cloths from where I was living in “Newfoundland,” bed sheets and linens gifted from friends, golden rod dyed second hand sheets, Japanese indigo dyed silk, lupine dyed cotton, second hand polyester, grommets, wood, house paint, screws, grommets, washers... a houses’s worth of thread<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
  (Dom)estic (Sub)let / Homesick Home Remedy is a fragmented neighbourhood set of sculptures, paintings, and drawings that include subtle clues about domestication, restriction, control, property, growing up, and being on the inside and the outside of the so-called “box.” Employing several material techniques of breaking apart materials and putting them back together, like patch-working fabric and mosaicing glass, this work aims to pick apart, interrogate, and reimagine the fictional construct that is “Western life” and what it has meant to grow up in a built environment in a white-cis-hetero-patriarichal colonial state. <br>
<br>
  The space literally and conceptually holds memories as well as the tensions of both longing for and resenting the recent past. Made at the age of 24, it is about being in a state of outgrowing, uncovering, reclaiming, and rebuilding the times and spaces that programmed the way we exist in the world. The works question the structures and grids which were meant to hold us and house the uncontainable fluidity that is family and community. The pieces attempt to depict key instruments of learning, achieving, and building in ways that are honest, poetic, cheeky, and subversive. Everything is created with naive materials, including construction paper, pencil crayons, games, paint, household linens, and mosaic and it feels like the exhibition was made by an inner child. Thus, (Dom)estic (Sub)let creates a space to reflect on and critique the politics we have inherited through domesticated spaces while simultaneously hoping to offer a place to imagine a softer shared future.<br>
